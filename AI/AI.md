## Different definitions

|               | Human Intelligence | Rational Performance |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Tought**    | Thinks like humans | Think rationally     |
| **Behaviour** | Act like humans    | Act rationally       |

### Thinking Humanly

**Cognitive model approach**: study how humans think to reproduce thought (psychology, human process simulation) -> first approach historically

* *Newell & Simon*: had this approach (study and define rationality)
* General Problem Solver (gps)

### Acting Humanly

* Intelligence = realization of a predefined performance.
* Turing test -> **operational **definition of intelligence, oriented to action

### Acting Rationally (rational agent approach)

* Intelligence without errors -> better than humans
* Are Humans Intelligent? There is a gap between knowing the goal and achieving the goal -> free will
* **Rational agents**: is this enough for intelligence?
* This approach involves using LOGIC
  * Not every problem can be fitted into logic approach
  * **LIMITED rationality**: act in an appropriate way which little time and information

For now, a **conventional definition** is used, constantly expanding

* *N. Nielsson:* AI is both a science (understanding intelligence) and an engineering (building intelligence)

## Origins of AI

### Precursors

* 150 AD - Heron of Alexandria: semiautomatic machines (AUTOMATA) (e.g. automatic doors ...)
  * First example of AUTONOMY
* 1200 - Ramon Lull: wanted to create a machine that could generate knowledge (*Ars Magna*) -> create a technique to find the truth

### Scientific revolution

* Descartes (1596-1650)
  * Rational actions and mechanical actions
* La Mettrie (1709-1751)
  * L’Homme Machine
* Pascal (1623-1662)
  * Mechanical calculator
* Leibniz (1646-1716)
  * Project of mechanizing rationality (calculus ratiocinator)
  * Axiomatic-deductive system

### Moderns

* Charles Babbage (1791-1871): create machines that can compute exactly without errors
  * Difference machine: automatic calculation of logarithmic tables
  * Analytical machine: introduced the concept of *memory* and *control system* as basic blocks
* Boole (1854): apply algebra to logic 
* Frege: invented *first order logic* and the notion of *proof*
  * Current notation was invented by Peano
* <u>1950 - Turing</u>  *COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE*
  * **Can computers think?**
  * *Computers* where people that had to calculate stuff, thus Digital Computers is the term that is referred to machine that could calculate precisely and automatically
  * Solved the problem of having a good language to express tough and logic and a good way to manipulate it
  * First definition of *Algorithm*
  * He wasn't trying to solve a practical problem (his problem was purely mathematics)

### Real Computers

* Z3, Eniac (1946)

### Cybernetics

* First model of artificial neurons

### Official Date

1956 - Artificial intelligence official birthdate: Workshop at Dartmouth (summer 1956)

*“The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every*
*aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in*
*principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made*
*to simulate it.”*
(McCarthy 1955)
