# Lecture 1

* What is computer science?
  * scientific discipline (empirical study of phenomena surrounding computers)
  * mathematical discipline (formal properties of a class of abstract structures)
  * technological discipline (cost-effective design and construction)
* How does science work
  * empiricism $\rightarrow$ only source of real knowledge is experience
  * mathematics $\rightarrow$  quantify phenomena
  * social structure $\rightarrow$ unique social structure of competition/cooperation

# Lecture 2-3

* Scientific revolution
  * Kepler $\rightarrow$ neoplatonic idea of finding mathematical harmony in structure of heavens
  * Galileo $\rightarrow$ telescope for observation
  * Newton $\rightarrow$ unified mathematical treatment of motion
* **Goals of science**
  * description
    * organization
    * explanation
  * prediction
    * control
* virtuous **relationship between technology and science**
  * technology: applied science? tools and machines?
  * creation of *artefacts* and design processes for those artefacts
    * *artefacts*: objects deliberately produced to fulfill some practical functions (function, physical composition, use)
  * sociotechnical systems composed of
    * physical objects
    * organizations, rules
    * people
* **Engineering**: activity that produces technology through processes
  * engineering sciences: scientific research in the context of technological applications
  * engineering has its own corpus of knowledge about the world, in particular about how the physical world can be made to meet requirements
  * **Technoscience** a kind of research where *theoretical representation* and *technical intervention* cannot be held apart even in thought

# Computation

* x is computable if
  * x is a function from a countable domain to a countable codomain
  * each x(a) can be obtained from a via an algorithmic process
    * Curch-Turing thesis: an MT captures exactly the concept of *effectively computable*
* x is computational if
  * x is a process
  * x is formulated in terms of computable functions
* x is a computer if
  * x is a physical system executing programs
